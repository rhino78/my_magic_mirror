## Magic mirror with mobile app and English Premier League Live table
I really liked all the [magic mirrors](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/3oktfu/magic_mirror_how_to/) I saw on reddit, so I decided to make my own. It has a moble app (which allows you to take selfies, and hide data you don't want pesky neighbors to know about), an English Premier League table that features arsenal previous match and next match data for Arsenal, the team I follow.


I hadn't worked with the [raspberry pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) before, but it was suprisingly really fun. I am constantly being asked by friends and neighbors, 'wow cool! what is that thing!'
